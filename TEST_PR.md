# 🧪 Test PR for CI/CD Pipeline

This is a test pull request to verify that our CI/CD pipeline works correctly.

## What this PR tests:
- ✅ Automatic training on PR
- ✅ Model quality testing
- ✅ Branch protection rules
- ✅ Status checks before merge

## Expected behavior:
1. GitHub Actions should run automatically
2. All jobs should pass (train → test)
3. Docker build should be skipped (only on main)
4. PR should be mergeable only if tests pass
